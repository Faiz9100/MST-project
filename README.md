# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Application

This Python Tkinter application implements Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given graph.

## Features

- Visual representation of the graph
- Implementation of Prim's algorithm
- Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm
- Interactive user interface using Tkinter

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mst-application.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd mst-application
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
2. Use the interface to draw the graph.
3. Select either Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST.
4. View the resulting MST on the graph.
